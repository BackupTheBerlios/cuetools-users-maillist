Subject: [cuetools-users] Status of package
Message-ID: <4BC16449.6070208@tudorholton.com>

Hey,

What's the current state of this package?  I notice that the last 
release was in 2006, and the last commit was in 2007 (and that was only 
to update the copyright).  That's over 2 years ago now.

There are also a few outstanding bugs both reported here and in many 
distributions.

Has anyone considered shifting bug reporting to Launchpad?  Launchpad 
would allow bugs to be consolidated upstream.

The bugs don't seem particularly significant codewise.  Would you be 
interested in having another developer?  I'm a programmer who 
specialises in GPL and LGPL code and would be willing to take on this 
package.

Cheers,
Tudor.
